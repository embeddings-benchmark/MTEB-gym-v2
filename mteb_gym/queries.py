Synthetic queries. The generator sees a few corpus documents and writes one
realistic query answerable from the corpus but not a restatement of a shown
document. Filtering is the biggest lever on agreement with ground truth; three
gates, cheapest first: length/degeneracy heuristics, an LLM quality score
(keep >= min_score), near-duplicate removal by token overlap.
